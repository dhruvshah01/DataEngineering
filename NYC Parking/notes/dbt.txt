We begin with installing dbt-core:
pip install dbt-core==1.6.1 (can specify the version)

We install the connection driver between dbt and duckdb:
pip install dbt-duckdb==1.6.0

We finally install duckdb: 
pip install duckdb==0.9.0

Finally we initialize:
dbt init

dbt init creates a nice structre which will have dbt_project.yml which is important to us
Now we setup a profiles.yml for the structre

touch profiles.yml

copy paste the basic code from dbt documentation

change the default tag to the name of the project in the dbt_project.yml

give path tag to our db

Create a sql file in the models folder:
touch name.sql

Compile it using,
dbt compile

Run it using,
dbt run

Reference model lineage graph:
dbt docs generate

To view the lineage graph:
dbt docs serve

For documentation,
we create a docs directory,
create a schema.yml which has some base code
create a docs_block.md and some jinjer sytnaxes

For tests,
we create a test directory,
there are 3 different types of tests, so accordingly create a sub-folder
define a sql file containing the jinjer sytnaxes and the test code
